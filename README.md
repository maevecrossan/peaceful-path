I decided to omit the last opportunity as I knew more time would be needed to learn how to create a gallery through which to display images, videos and audio. My main concern was making the display of the media match the rest of the website in terms of cleanliness and simplicity. I decided it was not a priority for this project, but would certainly be something I would have liked to have added, had there been enough time to learn, practice and execute it.

### Wireframe Mockups
I used the app Procreate on my iPad to draw and map out the basic structure of each page. I opted to use this app as I am very familiar with it, gives me complete creative freedom, and allows me to make adjustments very easily.

## Features

### Common Features
#### Colour Palette
I used Procreate to create my colour scheme by pulling colours from the hero image. This helped me create a rough colour palette which I used until the project was about 80% done. The original colours were modified towards the end of the project to improve accessibility.
The colours I used are as follows:
* rgb (66, 84, 72) or #425448 for the header and footer background.
* rgb (255, 255, 255) or #ffffff for the header font, the footer font and the (alternating) body text/div backgrounds.
* rgb (110, 127, 115) or #6E7F73 for the box-shadow.
* rgb (131, 150, 137) or #839689 for the main background.
* rgb (85, 105, 91) or #55695B for the (alternating) body text/div background.
