                <h2>What is mindfulness?</h2>
                <p>Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present and aware of our thoughts, feelings, sensations, and surroundings without judgement. It involves paying attention to the present moment with acceptance and openness, promoting mental clarity, emotional balance, and overall well-being.
